# HPCMCI-TPA-LSTM: Causality Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for Quality Characteristic Prediction

## Overview

HPCMCI-TPA-LSTM is a deep learning framework designed to predict quality characteristics from long sequence multivariate time-series data. This project is associated with the research paper "Causality enhanced deep learning framework for quality characteristic prediction via long sequence multivariate time-series data". The framework leverages causality to enhance the prediction accuracy of deep learning models, specifically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It requires MATLAB r2018a, Python 3.8 and PyTorch Lightning 2.2.1 for its implementation.

## Key Features
