# HPCMCI-TPA-LSTM: Causality Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for Quality Characteristic Prediction

## Overview

HPCMCI-TPA-LSTM is a deep learning framework designed to predict quality characteristics from long sequence multivariate time-series data. This project is associated with the research paper "Causality enhanced deep learning framework for quality characteristic prediction via long sequence multivariate time-series data". The framework leverages causality to enhance the prediction accuracy of deep learning models, specifically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It requires MATLAB R2018a, Python 3.8 and PyTorch Lightning 2.2.1 for its implementation.

## Key Features

- **Causality Enhancement**: Incorporates causal relationships to improve prediction accuracy.
- **TPA-LSTM Network**: Utilizes Temporal Pattern Attention-Long Short-Term Memory networks for handling sequential data.
- **Multivariate Time-Series Data**: Capable of processing data with multiple variables over time.
- **Quality Characteristic Prediction**: Focuses on predicting quality characteristics in industrial settings.
